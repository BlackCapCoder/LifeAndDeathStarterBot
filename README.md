# LifeDeathStarterBot

This is a starter bot for the [Game of life and death over at riddles.io](https://starapple.riddles.io/competitions/game-of-life-and-death), written by me so that you don't have to.

If you're on some kind of unix system you can run the `deploy` script to stick everything inside the `executable` folder in a zip file for uploading to the website.
